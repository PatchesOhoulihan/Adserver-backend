# Adserver

A little Adserver I wrote for fun

## Getting Started

Clone the repo(It contains a Netbeans Project) nothing new here.

### Prerequisites

1.) Run Composer out of Netbeans
2.) Clone the [Frontend](https://github.com/PatchesOhoulihan/Adserver-frontend.git) 
Repository and follow the Installation Notes there(even there are almost any).


### Run

Simply execute the Project. To start the Backend.

Than the Monitoring page shows up in your Browser.

NOTE: For the some particular Reasons I'm not providing any of the SQL Database
Structure.

Head over to the frontend Project and run it.
